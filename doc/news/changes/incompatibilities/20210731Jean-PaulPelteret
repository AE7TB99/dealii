Deprecated: Many of the member functions of the FEInterfaceValues class, as well
as the FEInterfaceViews::Scalar and FEInterfaceViews::Vector classes, that are
used to compute jumps and averages of shape function-related quantities have
been renamed in such a way that they are more expressive about what they
compute.
