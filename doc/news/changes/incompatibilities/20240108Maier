Removed: The rarely used long double variants `std_cxx17::legendrel` and
`std_cxx17::cyl_bessel_jl` have been removed due to a compatibility issue
with boost-1.83. If you happen to use these functions in your project
you can change to using `std::legendrel` and `std::cyl_bessel_jl` directly,
which are provided by the C++ standard template library.
