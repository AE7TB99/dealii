Changed: The operator `std::ostream << Vector` was implemented by
calling Vector::print() with default arguments. This implies a
particular formatting of the output that was independent of the flags
set on the output stream (in particular relating to how floating point
numbers are to be formatted), and also added a newline to the end of
the output. Both the formatting and the newline are decisions that are
better made by the user at the location where the output is
requested. As a consequence, the behavior has now been changed:
`operator<<` now simply outputs all elements of the vector as
individual numbers for which the output stream flags are respected,
and separated by a single space; no endline is appended to the output
any more.
