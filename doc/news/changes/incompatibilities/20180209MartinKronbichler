New: The class FE_DGQHermite has been switched to the more stable polynomial
basis Polynomials::HermiteLikeInterpolation. This changes the representation
of the numbers by the FE_DGQHermite class. The change is yet highly beneficial
because it significantly improves the accuracy (in terms of roundoff) for this
basis and also reduces iteration counts for some iterative solvers with simple
preconditioner ingredients such as point-Jacobi or point-Jacobi smoothing.
