Changed: GridTools::orthogonal_equality() now returns a
std::optional<unsigned char> instead of a
std::optional<std::bitset<3>>. As a consequence,
PeriodicFacePair now also stores an unsigned char instead of
a std::bitset<3> to represent the relative orientation of the first face to the
second face.
