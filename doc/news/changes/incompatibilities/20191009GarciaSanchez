Changed: The type of exact_solution in VectorTools::integrate_difference() was
double and fe_function could have any numerical type (double, float,
std::complex<double> or std::complex<float>). This would lead in certain cases
to unnecessary casts, for example from double to float. In addition it was not
possible to compare a std::complex exact_solution to a std::complex fe_function.
Now the types of exact_solution and fe_function must be the same, as a result
integrate_difference() can be used to compare a std::complex exact_solution to
a std::complex fe_function. The old version of the function has been deprecated.
