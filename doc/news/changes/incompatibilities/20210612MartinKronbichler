Updated: FE_RaviartThomasNodal now uses a different polynomial space to allow
for a simpler use for faces in non-standard orientation. The new polynomials
are anisotropic tensor products of Lagrange polynomials on the points of a
Gauss--Lobatto quadrature formula. This change leads to different entries in
the matrices and constraints, for example, but as the resulting polynomial
space spans the same polynomials, no change in accuracy should be expected.
