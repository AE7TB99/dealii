Changed: The functions DoFHandler::n_locally_owned_dofs_per_processor(),
DoFHandler::locally_owned_dofs_per_processor() and
DoFHandler::locally_owned_mg_dofs_per_processor() previously returned a
reference to an internally stored array of index sets on all processors. As
this cannot scale to large processor counts, these functions have been marked
deprecated and only populate the internal vectors on the first demand. This
means that the first call must be a collective call on all MPI ranks to ensure
that the underlying MPI_Allgather function completes. Use the
new functions DoFHandler::compute_n_locally_owned_dofs_per_processor(),
DoFHandler::compute_locally_owned_dofs_per_processor() and
DoFHandler::compute_locally_owned_mg_dofs_per_processor() instead or, even
better for scalability, avoid them in favor of some local communication.
