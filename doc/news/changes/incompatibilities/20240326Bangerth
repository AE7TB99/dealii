Removed: The Tensor<0,dim> template had functions `begin_raw()` and
`end_raw()`, which had been deprecated for a couple of releases
already. They have been removed now.
<br>
Furthermore, the corresponding functions for the general
Tensor<rank,dim> template have been deprecated. They can still be used
for the time being, but only for the specific case `rank==1`. This is
because the underlying assumption of these functions is that tensors
store their elements in memory in a contiguous fashion, but that is
only true for the case `rank==1`. Similarly, the `make_array_view()`
function that takes tensors as input has been marked as deprecated,
and can only be used for rank-1 tensors from now on.
