Changed: The CoarseningStrategies struct has been moved out of the
parallel::distributed::CellDataTransfer class into a separate header and
is now treated as a namespace. Its static member functions are now free
functions and only take a `std::vector` as a parameter that contains all
the data from the children. Therefore, the `coarsening_strategy`
parameter for the constructor of the
parallel::distributed::CellDataTransfer class has to be adjusted
accordingly as well.
