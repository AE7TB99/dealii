Changed: The class MappingQ now applies a high-order mapping to a cells in the
mesh, not just the ones touching the boundary. This makes the class completely
equivalent to the previous class MappingQGeneric. All functionality in the
latter class has been integrated into the MappingQ class. This avoids errors
with curved manifolds in the interior of the domain, where MappingQ could lead
to gaps or overlaps in the computational domain. In case the slightly better
performance of using MappingQ1 in interior cells is desired,
hp::MappingCollection can be used to replicate the old behavior.
