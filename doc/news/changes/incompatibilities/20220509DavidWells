Improved: GridTools::get_coarse_mesh_description() no longer returns subcell data
corresponding to default values (i.e., when the manifold_id is
numbers::flat_manifold_id and when the boundary_id is
numbers::internal_face_boundary_id). By skipping this data, which is not required by
Triangulation::create_triangulation(), the total amount of data returned by this
function is significantly lowered (and, therefore, so is the cost of creating a new
Triangulation from the output).
