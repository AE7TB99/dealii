Fixed: During coarsening, we need to decide which finite element is assigned
to parent cells. The decision criterion was not consistent, but is now unified:
The least dominant element of their children will be picked, according to
hp::FECollection::find_dominated_fe_extended(). This affects the implementations
of SolutionTransfer, parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer, parallel::CellWeights,
and hp::DoFHandler.
