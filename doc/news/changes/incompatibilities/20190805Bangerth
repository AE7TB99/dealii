Changed: The GridOut::write_svg() function now no longer outputs the
cell level and number by default; this also obviates the need for the
colorbar and the caption. This is achieved by changing the defaults in
the constructor of the GridOutFlags::Svg structure. This likely comes
closer to what most users want to see from this function -- namely,
just the mesh for inclusion into text.
