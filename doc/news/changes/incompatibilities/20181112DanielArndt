Changed: Subscriptor::subscribe cannot be called with rvalue references anymore.
In particular, temporary string literals cannot be used as argument. Storing
string literals with the same content at the same memory location is
implementation defined and cannot be relied upon. On the other hand, the
subscriber strings are not compared by their memory address anymore but by their
actual content.
