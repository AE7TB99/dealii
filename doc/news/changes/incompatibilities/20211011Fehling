Changed: The 3D implementation of GridTools::rotate() with an integer
for a Cartesian coordinate direction has been superseded by the version
that accepts unit vectors as rotation axes. Further,
Physics::Transformations::Rotations::rotation_matrix_3d() now requires
a Tensor<1,3> object instead of a Point<3> as an axis.
