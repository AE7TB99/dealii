Removed: LogStream: The reproducible test functionality has been removed
from deallog. This includes <code>test_mode()</code>,
<code>threshold_double()</code>, and <code>threshold_float()</code>. Use
numdiff, or other tools that can do output comparison with small numerical
differences instead. Further, the <code>log_cerr()</code> function has been
removed.
