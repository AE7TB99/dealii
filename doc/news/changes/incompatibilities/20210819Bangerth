Deprecated: The Tensor and SymmetricTensor classes had functions
`begin_raw()` and `end_raw()` that suggested that the elements of
these objects are stored in arrays and consequently could be accessed
consecutively through iterators. While they are indeed stored
contiguously in memory, they are not part of an array and, as a
consequence, C++ does not actually allow this kind of access. The
functions have therefore been deprecated and will be removed in due
time.
<br>
As a consequence, the `make_array_view()` functions that allow turning
a Tensor or SymmetricTensor into an ArrayView object have now also
been deprecated.
