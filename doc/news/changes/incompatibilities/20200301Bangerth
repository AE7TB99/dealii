New: The underlying type for types::global_dof_index used to be
`unsigned long long int`. On all reasonable systems, this is actually
a 64-bit unsigned integer type, but the name wouldn't tell you that
unless you already knew. This is now fixed: Instead of the mouthful
of a type, we now use the more concise `uint64_t`: An unsigned integer
type with exactly 64 bits of accuracy.
<br>
Strictly speaking, this may be an incompatible change: On some
systems, `unsigned long long int` and `uint64_t` may have the same
size, but are not the same type. In practice, as long as you have used
the type `types::global_dof_index`, you will not see any difference at
all.
