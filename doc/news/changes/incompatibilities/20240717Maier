Changed: The GridIn::read() function variant taking a filename string no
longer uses PathSearch to try to find an appropriate file. Instead, the
function requires now that the filename string is a valid relative or
absolute path to mesh file in question. Additionally, GridIn::read() now
throws ExcFileNotOpen instead of PathSearch::FileNotFound.
