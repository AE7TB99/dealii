Changed: A number of classes implementing tensor-valued polynomials
had a member function called `compute_n_pols()`. This name has now
been changed to `n_polynomials()`, better reflecting our usual naming
scheme as well as what the function does -- which in many cases is not
actually computing but just returning something.
