Changed: SolverGMRES::AdditionalData now controls the size of the Arnoldi
basis through the new member variable
SolverGMRES::AdditionalData::max_basis_size, rather than the number of
temporary vectors (which is the basis size plus 2). As a result, the default
value of the basis size is now 30, compared to 28 used before. The old
variable SolverGMRES::AdditionalData::max_n_tmp_vectors is still available,
but whenever SolverGMRES::AdditionalData::max_basis_size is set to a non-zero
value (including the value set by the default constructor), the latter takes
precedence. Furthermore, the default algorithm has been changed from
the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm.
The latter uses unconditional reorthogonalization delayed by one step,
following the algorithm described in @cite Bielich2022.
