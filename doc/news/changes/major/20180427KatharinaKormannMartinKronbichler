New: The MatrixFree framework has been reworked to also support face integrals
in DG. The new function MatrixFree::loop() takes three function pointers for
workers on cells, interior faces and boundary faces. The loop can perform the
data exchange with MPI and is also parallelized with threads taking into
account the face dependencies. The new class FEFaceEvaluation implements the
respective evaluation and access routines for face terms.
