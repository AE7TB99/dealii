New: There is now a function-like macro `DEAL_II_NOT_IMPLEMENTED();`
that can be used to indicate places where something is not
implemented. If a code runs into a place where it appears, the program
is aborted (or, as documented, an exception is thrown). In contrast to
the old way of indicating such a thing (namely, writing
`Assert(false, ExcNotImplemented());`, the error is raised even in
release mode.
