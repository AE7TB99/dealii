New: A new class Differentiation::AD::ADHelperVectorFunction has been
added to help implement point-wise vector functions using automatic 
differentiation. In particular, this class is designed to compute the 
Jacobian of a vector function that is parameterized in
terms of scalar, vector, and tensor arguments. One example of its use
would be to compute the linearization of a multi-field constitutive
law that is expressed in terms of some kinetic variables.
