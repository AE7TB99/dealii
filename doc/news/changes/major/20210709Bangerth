New: VTU files have traditionally been used for visualization
purposes, but more recently they have also been used for more general
postprocessing tasks since they can easily be imported into Python,
for example. By setting the DataOutBase::VtkFlags::physical_units
variable and attaching such a flags object to a DataOut,
Particles::DataOut, or MatrixOut object, one can now specify the
physical units associated with variables that are written into VTU
files, so that they can be parsed by scripts that do further
postprocessing.
