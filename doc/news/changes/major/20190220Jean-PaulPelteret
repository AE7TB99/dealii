New: A new class Differentiation::AD::ADHelperScalarFunction has been
added to help implement point-wise scalar functions using automatic 
differentiation. In particular, this class is designed to compute the 
gradient and Hessian of a scalar function that is parameterized in
terms of scalar, vector, and tensor arguments. One example of its use
would be to compute the derivatives of a multi-field constitutive law
that is expressed in terms of an energy function.
