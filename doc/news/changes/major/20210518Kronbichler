New: The class FEPointEvaluation provides an interface to the evaluation of 
interpolated solution values and gradients on cells on arbitrary reference 
point positions. These points can change from cell to cell, both with 
respect to their quantity as well to the location. The two typical use 
cases are evaluations on non-matching grids and particle simulations.
