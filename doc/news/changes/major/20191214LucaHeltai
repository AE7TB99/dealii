New: The SymbolicFunction<dim> class allows one to leaverage the SymEngine library to generate
dealii::Function objects where the gradients, Laplacians, and Hessians are computed symbolically
providing also the possibility to extract the time derivative of the SymbolicFunction<dim> object
as another SymbolicFunction<dim> object.
