Improved: The mesh smoothing algorithms applied in the Triangulation class and
MappingQGeneric have been changed from the old Laplace-style smoothing to a
transfinite interpolation that linearly blends between the descriptions on the
faces around a cell. The old transformation introduced boundary layers inside
cells that prevented convergence rates to exceed 3.5 in the global L2 errors
on typical settings, whereas all derivatives in the mapping from unit to real
cell are bounded by the derivatives of the manifold description. This change
also considerably improves mesh quality on settings where curved descriptions
were only applied to the boundary rather than the whole volume.
