Improved: The manifold smoothing algorithms applied in the Triangulation class
and MappingQGeneric have been changed from the old Laplace-style smoothing to
a transfinite interpolation that linearly blends between the descriptions on
the faces around a cell. The old transformation introduced boundary layers
inside cells that prevented convergence rates from exceeding 3.5 in the global
L2 errors on typical settings. This change also considerably improves mesh
quality on settings where curved descriptions are only applied to the boundary
rather than the whole volume.
