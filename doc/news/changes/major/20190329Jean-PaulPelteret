New: A new class Differentiation::SD::Expression has been added. which allows
the creation and manipulation of scalar symbolic functions using the SymEngine
library. It will later be used as the basis of symbolic tensor calculus, amongst
other things. It incorporates numerous features, which currently include:
<ul>
  <li>expression parsing,</li>
  <li>comparison operations,</li>
  <li>logical operations,</li>
  <li>basic math operations,</li>
  <li>conditional expression construction,</li>
  <li>differentiation,</li>
  <li>substitution (partial and complete), and</li>
  <li>serialization.</li>
</ul>
