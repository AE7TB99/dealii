New: Several classes have been added to the NonMatching namespace for using cut
finite element methods (CutFEM):
<ul>
  <li>
    MeshClassifier identifies how active cells and faces are located relative
    to the zero contour of a level set function, by associating one of the
    values of the enum LocationToLevelSet: {inside, outside, intersected}, with
    each cell/face.
  </li>
  <li>
    QuadratureGenerator creates immersed quadrature rules over the 3 regions of
    a BoundingBox defined by the sign of a level set function.
    FaceQuadratureGenerator creates the same type of quadratures but over a
    face of a BoundingBox. DiscreteQuadratureGenerator and
    DiscreteFaceQuadratureGenerator create the same type of quadratures over a
    cell/face when the level set function lies in a finite element space.
  </li>
  <li>
    FEImmersedSurfaceValues is a FEValues-like class for evaluating real space
    values based on an ImmersedSurfaceQuadrature, i.e., for integrating over
    the zero contour in a cell.
  </li>
  <li>
    NonMatching::FEValues simplifies assembling by creating dealii::FEValues
    and FEImmersedSurfaceValues objects initialized with the 3 different
    immersed quadratures of a cell. Analogously, NonMatching::FEInterfaceValues
    creates dealii::FEInterfaceValues objects initialized with immersed
    quadrature rules over a face.
  </li>
</ul>
