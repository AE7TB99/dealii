New: Support for Ginkgo, a high-performance numerical linear algebra library
has been added. Ginkgo provides advanced highly optimized linear solvers,
matrix formats and an abstraction to easily create linear operators on both
the cpu and the gpu. The deal.II's Ginkgo interface can currently be used to
solve linear systems using Krylov solvers with the cuda and OpenMP paradigms.
