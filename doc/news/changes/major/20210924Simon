New: Added an interface to p4est_search.h (>=v2.2) to find the MPI
rank of cells owning remote points without communication. This
works in the special (but not uncommon) case that no nontrivial 
manifold is attached to the triangulation, i.e., the triangulation
has only FlatManifold attached to it.
