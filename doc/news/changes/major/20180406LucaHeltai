New: Triangulation now uses std::unique_ptr to store Manifolds, and duplicates the Manifolds when 
Triangulation::set_manifold() is called. This allows the construction of the Manifold objects
to be independent of the Triangulation. In particular, it will be possible to associate
to the Triangulation reasonable default Manifold descriptors, that will be copied 
around together with the Triangulation itself.
