New: Add a mask argument to filter out some vector lanes in FEEvaluationBase
Complemented by a test, which is almost the same as advect_1d but the distribute_local_to_global is called with the mask argument and each entry is written separately, yielding the same results as the original test.
This commit is required for local time stepping using the MatrixFree framework, because some cells of batches must be excluded from read/write operations when operating on different time steps compared to their neighbor cells.
