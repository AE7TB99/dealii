Fixed: Manifold::get_new_point() previously ignored points weighted negatively.
The original intent was to avoid to divide by a 0 weight, but the condition
weight < tolerance resulted in ignoring negative weights.
Additionally, the same function previously avoided get_intermediate_point()
when the weight of of the first point was 0, but forgot to assign the new
intermediate point to be the second point.
The issues would mainly occur for derived Manifold classes that only implement
the get_intermediate_point() function. Both issues are now fixed.
