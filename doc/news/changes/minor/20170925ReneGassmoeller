New: There are new signals in the Triangulation class
that signal the beginning and end of a parallel::distributed
refinement and serialization. This allows to connect functions
that should be called uniquely once before and after
refinement and serialization for parallel distributed
Triangulations (something not possible with the existing
signals).
