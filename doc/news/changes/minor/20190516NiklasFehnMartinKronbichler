Improved: The function GridGenerator::torus() run in 3D (volume mesh) would
previously only use a single cell to represent the poloidal shape, which leads
to singular mappings similar to how a circle degenerates when meshed with a
single cell. The poloidal shape is now represented with 5 cells just like the
circle. Furthermore, the function GridGenerator::torus() has gained an
optional argument to control the number of cell layers in the toroidal
direction. The default manifold set to the torus has also been improved: Now,
the TorusManifold is applied on the surface, a CylindricalManifold to the
middle cells in toroidal coordinates, and a TransfiniteInterpolationManifold
on the cells between the surface and the inner ring. This leads to an
excellent mesh quality for all supported scenarios.
