Improved: The setup of MappingQGeneric::InternalData within the constructor of
FEValues would previously unconditionally allocate memory for all shape
functions and all quadrature points, also for the case where we use the tensor
product and the full interpolation is unnecessary. This has been fixed,
improving the situation for very high orders and numbers of quadrature points
(e.g., avoiding 400 MB of memory for mapping degrees of 15 with $16^3$
quadrature points in 3D).
