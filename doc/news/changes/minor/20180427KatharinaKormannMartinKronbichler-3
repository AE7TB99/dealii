New: There are new functions FEEvaluation::gather_evaluate() and
FEEvaluation::integrate_scatter() that combine the vector access through
FEEvaluation::read_dof_values() and FEEvaluation::evaluate() as well as
FEEvaluation::integrate() and
FEEvaluation::distribute_local_to_global(), respectively. This allows to
write somewhat more compact code and is also more efficient in the case
of FEFaceEvaluation where equivalent functions exists.
