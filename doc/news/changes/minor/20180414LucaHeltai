New: Introduced Triangulation::reset_manifold(), as a substitute for Triangulation::set_manifold()
with only one argument. The set_manifold() method with one argument only was used to reset the manifold
object. This method is now deprecated, in favor of the new, more explicative, method. 
An additional Triangulation::reset_all_manifolds() method has been added to remove all manifold 
objects from the triangulation.
