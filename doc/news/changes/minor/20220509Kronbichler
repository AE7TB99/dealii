New: The class SolverCG now supports the interleaving of vector operations
with the matrix-vector product. The prerequisite is an associated `MatrixType`
class to provide a `vmult` class with two `std::function` objects to specify
the operation before and after the matrix-vector product, and a
`PreconditionerType` class that provides either a function `apply` to apply
the preconditioner action on a single element or and `apply_to_subrange(const
unsigned int, const unsigned int) const` that can selectively apply the
precondition on a part of a vector. For optimal performance, the matrix and
preconditioner types need to agree on suitable sizes for the sub-ranges.
