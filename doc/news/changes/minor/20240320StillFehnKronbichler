Improved: The isotropic refinement function 
TriangulationImplementation::Implementation::execute_refinement_isotropic() 
now supports 2 additional ways to split a tetrahedron into its children. 
Cutting the parent between the 2 edge midpoints, which are the shortest 
distance apart, leads to more regular refined cells and optimal convergence 
under mesh refinement.
