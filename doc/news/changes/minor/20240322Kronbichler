Changed: The class FEEvaluationAccess, which was previously used to control
access to values, gradients and Hessians at quadrature points in specialized
form for scalar, vector-valued and general n-component system, has been merged
into the class FEEvaluationBase, using conditional types deduced from
std::conditional. This should not change any application code, but reduced the
amount of code by 1,500 lines, thus making the library simpler to maintain.
