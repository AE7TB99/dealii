New: PreconditionChebyshev can now also estimate eigenvalues with the power
method, rather than the Lanczos algorithm underlying the SolverCG
estimation. This is useful for matrices that are slightly non-symmetric such
that the eigenvalue estimate of SolverCG breaks down, but not too much so that
the Chebyshev iteration is still a useful iteration.
