Fixed: MGLevelGlobalTransfer::copy_to_mg would initialize the level vectors
without ghosts. When combined with Chebyshev smoother and a DiagonalMatrix as
well as specific matrix-free loops, this could lead to ghosted vectors in
places where they were not supposed to be ghosted, leading to exceptions. This
is now fixed.
