Fixed: When using diagonal SymmetricTensors with automatic-differentiable numbers, computations
using the eigenvalue() and eigenvector() functions would return correct values of the
eigenvalues/vectors. However, the derivatives of these values/vectors were incorrect as
the sensitivities of the eigenvalues/vectors with respect to one another was not encoded
in the returned result. Therefore, under these specific conditions the returned result is now
a more coarse approximation for the eigenvalues/vectors but with the trade-off that a
meaningful approximation of the derivative of the result can now be computed.
