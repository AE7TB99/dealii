New: MGTransferMatrixFree::build() now takes an optional second argument to
specify partitioner objects for LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector types in
use elsewhere. If the ghost indices required by the multigrid algorithm are
contained in the ghosts of the given partitioners, they can be used, saving
some vector copy operations during MGTransferMatrixFree::restrict_and_add()
and MGTransferMatrixFree::prolongate().
