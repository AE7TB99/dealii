Improved: The asserts in parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer have
been improved. Before this change, an assert has been only called
in the parallel case for distributed vectors for cells neighboring
interprocess boundaries. Now, we check for all DoFs that the 
contributions from all cells have the same values. This condition
might be not given if the solution has high gradients at hanging
nodes.
