New: compare_and_apply_mask() allows to use a ternary operater idiom with
VectorizedArray that is based on generating a mask via component-wise
comparison. Such a computational idiom is useful as an alternative to
branching whenever the control flow itself would depend on (computed) data
(which is not possible for vectorized data).
