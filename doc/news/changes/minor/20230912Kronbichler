Improved: FEEvaluation::get_gradient() and FEEvaluation::submit_gradient() are
now considerably faster for Raviart-Thomas elements on non-Cartesian meshes.
The previous algorithm used non-optimal loop layouts for the local tensor
contractions in the derivative of the Piola transform, which have been
transformed to optimal-complexity variants.
