Changed: For 1d cells, the following code did not compile:
@code
    for (const auto &face : cell->face_iterators())
      if (face->at_boundary())
        {
          face->set_boundary_id(1);
        }
@endcode
That was because, unlike in the 2d and 3d case, the class that
describes the faces of 1d cells had a `set_boundary_id()` function
that was not marked as `const`. This has now been fixed by adding the
`const` specification for this function, along with the one on the
`set_all_boundary_ids()` function.
