New: SolverGMRES and SolverFGMRES can now use an additional orthogonalization
strategy, controlled by
LinearAlgebra::OrthogonalizationStrategy::delayed_classical_gram_schmidt. This
implements the classical Gram-Schmidt method with delayed reorthogonalization,
a low-synchronization algorithm (performing one global reduction per GMRES
iteration for deal.II's own vectors) that has excellent stability properties.
