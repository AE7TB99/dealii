Improved: DoFHandler::renumber_dofs() on parallel::distributed::Triangulation
would scale linearly with the number of MPI ranks on more than 50k ranks,
reaching times of more than 10 seconds on 150k ranks. This is now fixed for
the case the renumbering does not lead to a change in the underlying IndexSet
field of locally owned unknowns, i.e., in case the numbers merely change
within each MPI rank but not across them.
