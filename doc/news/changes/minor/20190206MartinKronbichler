Improved: The FEEvaluation::evaluate() and FEEvaluation::integrate() routines
would previously unconditionally use an evaluation routine with a
transformation to a collocation basis and subsequent collocation derivative
for `n_q_points_1d > fe_degree` because it is faster for the usual case of
`n_q_points_1d` close to the polynomial degree. Now, we switch back to the
standard evaluation if `n_q_points_1d > 3 * (fe_degree+1) / 2` where that
variant is faster.
