Fixed: PreconditionChebyshev would previously run one iteration more than
requested, i.e., perform `degree+1` matrix-vector products rather than
`degree` which is the convention in literature. This is now fixed. Note that
the quality of PreconditionChebyshev is obviously slightly reduced by this
change, and some solvers might need more outer iterations due to a ligher
Chebyshev iteration.
