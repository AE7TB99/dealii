Fixed: Manifold::normal_vector() used to pick two directions that are almost
linearly dependent quite often, which resulted in very bad accuracy of the
normal vectors. This has been fixed. The downstream use of this function on
curved geometries in VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints() has now
become much more accurate and robust.
