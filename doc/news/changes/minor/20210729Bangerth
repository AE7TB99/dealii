Fixed: AlignedVector objects for which
AlignedVector::replicate_across_communicator() had previously been
called, could not be move-constructed or move-assigned: The resulting
object was usable, but destruction of the target object led to memory
errors that aborted the program. This is now fixed. As a side effect
of the patch, memory consumption of AlignedVector objects has also
been shrunk for the most common case where
AlignedVector::replicate_across_communicator() has not actually been called.
