Changed: The DataOutBase::write_deal_II_intermediate() function had a
bug when outputting data that corresponds to cells other than
hypercubes. This is now fixed. In the process, the format version for
this function's output has been incremented from 3 to 4, which also
includes changing the order in which vertices are outputted.
<br>
The DataOutReader class was also updated to match the new output
format.
