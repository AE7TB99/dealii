New: There is now a function VectorizedArray::streaming_store() that
stores the content of a vectorized array into another array which bypasses the
CPU's caches on supported architectures using _mm_stream_pd() intrinsics. This
operation is useful because it can avoid the read-for-ownership memory access
on large arrays and directly write to the destination for streaming
stores. However, it can also be detrimental to performance in case the store
would fit into caches. This new function is not used within the library
because only the final user code knows the properties of hardware and whether
a particular store pattern is so large that it will not fit into caches and
thus benefit from this optimization.
