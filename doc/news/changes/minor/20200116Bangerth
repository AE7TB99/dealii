Deprecated: The CellAccessor::active() function did not satisfy the
usual naming scheme of that class in which functions are called
CellAccessor::is_ghost(), CellAccessor::is_locally_owned(), etc. As a
consequence, there is now a new function CellAccessor::is_active(),
with the old function deprecated.
