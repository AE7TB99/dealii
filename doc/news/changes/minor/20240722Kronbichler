New: There is a new initialization function MGTwoLevelTransfer::reinit() that
takes two MatrixFree objects to describe a p-coarsening transfer operation,
besides the previous option of computing the information via two separate
DoFHandler objects. The new option is faster to set up and more memory
efficient in case the MatrixFree objects already are available, such as when
using those to define the level operators.
