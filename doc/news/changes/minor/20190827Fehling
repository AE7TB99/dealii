Bugfix: For parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects, p4est determines
which cells will be refined and coarsened. Thus, refinement flags are not
a good measure to predict refinement behavior for transferring active finite
element indices. We now provide a matching coarsening strategy to the
parallel::distributed::CellDataTransfer object responsible for their transfer.
This fixes assertions being triggered in
parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer::interpolate().
