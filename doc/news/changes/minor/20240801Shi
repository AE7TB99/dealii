Fix: Corrected pointer iteration range in VectorBase::mean_value()
and VectorBase::lp_norm() in PETScWrappers namespace to proper handle
distributed PETSc vectors. Now pointers obtained via VecGetArrayRead()
iterate only over locally_owned_size(), and results are correctly
aggregated across processes.
