Improved: The internal implementation of the tensor-product evaluators used
for FEEvaluation and FEFaceEvaluation has been cleaned up. This reduces the
compile times for both the deal.II library and code using FEEvaluation with
template parameters on the polynomial degrees. Also, the code is now simpler
to maintain, especially for the evaluators for Raviart-Thomas elements.
