Fixed: In parallel computations, the DoFRenumbering::hierarchical()
function created DoF indices that were dependent on the previous DoF
indices owned by each processor. This was not intended: the new DoF
indices were supposed to only depend on the order of cells, not any
previous numbering. This is now fixed.
