Fixed: When accessing elements of Trilinos vectors that do not exist
on the current MPI process (for example because a function *expects* a
vector with ghost elements but got a completely distributed vector
instead), deal.II tries to produce a reasonable error message pointing
out the cause. But when using 64-bit indices, the logic that creates
the error message was faulty, resulting in errors that were very hard
to debug and not helpful at all. This is now fixed.
