Improved: The implementations of SolverGMRES and SolverFGMRES have been
overhauled and made more similar. In particular, SolverFGMRES now uses the
same internal algorithm to solve the minimization problem in the Arnoldi
basis, employing Givens rotations in analogy to the setting used by
SolverGMRES. Since the Arnoldi process is sensitive to roundoff errors, this
change might slightly affect iteration counts (often giving slightly better
results).
