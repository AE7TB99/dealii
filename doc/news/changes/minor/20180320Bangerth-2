Fixed: Previously, it was not possible to iterate over the local range
of rows of PETSc matrix objects because one would have to call
`matrix.end(row)` where `row` is the last locally owned row, and that
triggered an assertion because this end iterator is also the begin
iterator of the next row -- which is not locally owned any more.

This is now fixed.
