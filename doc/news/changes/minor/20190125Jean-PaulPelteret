Improved: A new dummy enumeration AD::NumberTypes::none has been added.
It exists to represent number types that are scalar arithmetic types, 
i.e those that hold no derivatives. They are implemented primarily to 
facilitate the use of template  meta-programming techniques to switch 
between different AD types. This covers the case when the user does not 
want an AD type at all, but rather a primitive type.
