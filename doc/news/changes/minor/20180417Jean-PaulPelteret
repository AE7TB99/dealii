New: Cell weighting can now be taken into account by the Metis partitioner. This can be done directly
using the new GridTools::partition_triangulation() function that accepts a vector of cell weights,
or by adding the appropriate signal to the triangulation itself (Triangulation::Signals::cell_weight).
