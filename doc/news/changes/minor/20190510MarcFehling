New: Introduced indices for future finite elements that cells will be assigned
to after the triangulation changes. The future_fe_index of each cell can be
accessed and changed via member functions of the DoFCellAccessor class,
namely DoFCellAccessor::future_fe_index(), DoFCellAccessor::set_future_fe_index(),
DoFCellAccessor::future_fe_index_set(), and DoFCellAccessor::clear_future_fe_index().
