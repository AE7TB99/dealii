Fixed: The member variable FEEvaluation::dofs_per_cell and the static variable
FEEvaluation::tensor_dofs_per_cell only returned the number of degrees of
freedom per scalar component also for vector-valued evaluators, rather than
returning the number accumulated over all components in the evaluator. This is
now fixed.
