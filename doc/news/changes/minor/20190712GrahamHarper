Improved: FE_PolyTensor now supports finite elements with different mapping 
types for each shape function. The member variable mapping_type is now of 
type std::vector<MappingType>. If the vector contains only one MappingType, 
then the same mapping is applied to every shape function. If a list of 
MappingTypes is provided, mapping_type[i] will be applied to shape function i.
