New: When calling `cell->vertex_dof_index(...)` on a DoFHandler that
uses the hp capability, then one needed to provide the last argument
indicating what the active fe index is. But for cells, there can only
be one active fe index, so leaving the last argument at its default
value is now interpreted as using the active fe index of the cell. The
argument still needs to be provided if the `vertex_dof_index()`
function is called on faces, edges, or vertices.
