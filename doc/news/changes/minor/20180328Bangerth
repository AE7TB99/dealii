Fixed: Threads::Thread<T> and Threads::Task<T> objects can now also be
used when @p T is a type that is only move-constructable or movable,
but not necessarily copy-constructible or copyable. Consequently, one
can now also call functions that return such objects on tasks and
threads. In particular, this is relevant for functions that return
std::unique_ptr objects that have this property.
