New: FEInterfaceViews now has functions get_*_function_values() and 
get_*_function_values_from_local_dof_values() to evaluate solution 
values across cell faces, such as the jump in (or average of) values, 
gradients, and Hessians. With these functions, FEInterfaceValues 
can now be used with automatic differentiation.
