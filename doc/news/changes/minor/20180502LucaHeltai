New: NonMatching::create_coupling_sparsity_pattern and NonMatching::create_coupling_mass_matrix now have an
overloaded version that takes an additional GridTools::Cache, instead of 
building it inside the functions. In the process, NonMatching::create_coupling_sparsity_pattern
gained also an additional ConstraintMatrix argument to reflect the same argument list of 
its companion function NonMatching::create_coupling_mass_matrix.
